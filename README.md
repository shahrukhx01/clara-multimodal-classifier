# clara-multimodal-classifier

A self-contained recipe for training a multimodal classifier on a speech and language parallel dataset, for downstream classification tasks, based on the [CLARA: Multilingual Contrastive Learning for Audio Representation Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11830) paper.

To train on any multimodal dataset please refer to my [blogpost](https://shahrukhx01.github.io/clara-multimodal-classifier).

For starting the training please run:

```bash
python -m scripts.run_training_multimodal
```
